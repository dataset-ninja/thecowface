**Thecowface** is a dataset for object detection tasks. It is used in the livestock industry.

The dataset consists of 344 images with 466 labeled objects belonging to 1 single class (*cow_face*).

Each image in the Thecowface dataset has bounding box annotations. All images are labeled (i.e. with annotations). There are 3 splits in the dataset: *test* (34 images), *valid* (69 images), and *train* (241 images). The dataset was released in 2023 by the [Roboflow community](https://universe.roboflow.com/face-cow).

Here is the visualized example grid with annotations:
